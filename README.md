# Thanks for Checking Out this Tutorial

Hello,
I spent a few days getting into this application but as it turns out Docsify does not have the features I need. I am going to move on to other things, but I may come back to this if Codsify is applicable to another project.

If anybody would like to become a contributor to expand this project please let me know by going to Issues ["Become a Contributor"](https://github.com/jadedrakerider/Docsify-Tutorial/issues/2) thread. I will see it and get back to you as soon as I can.
