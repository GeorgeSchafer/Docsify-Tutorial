# Thanks for Checking Out this Tutorial

Hello,
I spent a few days getting into this application but as it turns out Docsify does not have the features I need. I am going to move on to other things, but I may come back to this if Codsify is applicable to another project.

If anybody would like to become an owner to expand this project, or just contribute, please let me know by going to Issues and the ["Become a Co-Owner"](https://github.com/jadedrakerider/Docsify-Tutorial/issues/1) and ["Become a Contributor"](https://github.com/jadedrakerider/Docsify-Tutorial/issues/2) threads. I will see them and get back to you as soon as I can.
